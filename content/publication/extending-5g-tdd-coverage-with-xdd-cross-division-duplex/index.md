abstract: In this paper, an advanced duplex scheme called cross-division duplex
  (XDD) is proposed to enhance uplink (UL) coverage in time division duplex
  (TDD) carriers by utilizing self-interference cancellation (SIC) capability at
  a base station. With XDD, it is possible to combine TDD’s ability to
  efficiently handle asymmetric UL and downlink (DL) traffic with frequency
  division duplex’s coverage advantage. To do so, XDD simultaneously operates UL
  and DL on the same TDD carrier but on different frequency resources. Such
  operation leads to severe interference on the received UL signal at the base
  station which requires two levels of SIC implementation; antenna and digital
  SIC. More than 50 dB of interference is removed through the antenna SIC using
  electromagnetic barriers between the transmitting and receiving antennas. The
  remaining interference is removed by the digital SIC based on estimating the
  non-linear channel of the circuit at the receiver baseband. It is verified by
  simulation and analysis that with the proposed XDD, the UL coverage can be
  improved by up to 2.37 times that of TDD. To check the feasibility of XDD, a
  Proof-of-Concept was developed where it was observed that the benefits of XDD
  can indeed be realized using the proposed SIC techniques.
