abstract: Massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO)
  provides high spectral efficiency by means of spatial multiplexing and
  fine-grained beamforming. However, conventional base-station (BS)
  architectures for systems with hundreds of antennas that rely on centralized
  baseband processing inevitably suffer from (i) excessive interconnect data
  rates between radio-frequency circuitry and processing fabrics, and (ii)
  prohibitive complexity at the centralized baseband processor. Recently,
  decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architectures and algorithms have been
  proposed, which mitigate the interconnect bandwidth and complexity
  bottlenecks. This paper systematically explores the design trade-offs between
  error-rate performance, computational complexity, and data transfer latency of
  DBP architectures under different system configurations and channel
  conditions. Considering architecture, algorithm, and numerical precision
  aspects, we provide practical guidelines to select the DBP architecture and
  algorithm that are able to realize the full benefits of massive MU-MIMO in the
  uplink and downlink.
