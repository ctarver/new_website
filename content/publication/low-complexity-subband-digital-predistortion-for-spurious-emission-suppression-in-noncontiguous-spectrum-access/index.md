abstract: Noncontiguous transmission schemes combined with high power-efficiency
  requirements pose big challenges for radio transmitter and power amplifier
  (PA) design and implementation. Due to the nonlinear nature of the PA, severe
  unwanted emissions can occur, which can potentially interfere with neighboring
  channel signals or even desensitize the own receiver in frequency division
  duplexing transceivers. In this paper, to suppress such unwanted emissions, a
  low-complexity subband digital predistortion solution, specifically tailored
  for spectrally noncontiguous transmission schemes in low-cost devices, is
  proposed. The proposed technique aims at mitigating only the selected spurious
  intermodulation distortion components at the PA output, hence allowing for
  substantially reduced processing complexity compared with classical
  linearization solutions. Furthermore, novel decorrelation-based parameter
  learning solutions are also proposed and formulated, which offer reduced
  computing complexity in parameter estimation as well as the ability to track
  time-varying features adaptively. Comprehensive simulation and RF measurement
  results are provided, using a commercial LTE-Advanced mobile PA, to evaluate
  and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in real-world
  scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that highly efficient spurious
  component suppression can be obtained using the proposed solutions.
