abstract: Digital predistortion is the process of using digital signal
  processing to correct nonlinearities caused by the analog RF front-end of a
  wireless transmitter. These nonlinearities contribute to adjacent channel
  leakage, degrade the error vector magnitude of transmitted signals, and often
  force the transmitter to reduce its transmission power into a more linear but
  less power-efficient region of the device. Most predistortion techniques are
  based on polynomial models with an indirect learning architecture which have
  been shown to be overly sensitive to noise. In this work, we use neural
  network-based predistortion with a novel neural network training method that
  avoids the indirect learning architecture and that shows significant
  improvements in both the adjacent channel leakage ratio and error vector
  magnitude. Moreover, we show that, by using a neural network based
  predistorter, we are able to achieve a 42% reduction in latency and 9.6%
  increase in throughput on an FPGA accelerator with 15% fewer multiplications
  per sample when compared to a similarly performing memory-polynomial
  implementation.
