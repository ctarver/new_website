abstract: The upcoming deployments of devices on the new 3.5 GHz, Citizens
  Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is expected to enable innovation by lowering
  the barrier to entry into LTE and other technologies. With a three-tiered
  spectrum-sharing solution, the CBRS band promises to allow coexistence of
  federal incumbent users, priority licensees, and general users. While there
  have been many works studying cellular traffic offloading to unlicensed bands
  (e.g., Licensed Assisted Access) or minimizing interference in Cognitive Radio
  Networks, there has been comparatively little work on maximizing spatial reuse
  of spectrum in a shared spectrum CBRS network. Hence, the essence of this work
  is to leverage listen-before-talk (LBT) schemes over a CBRS network for
  increasing the spatial reuse at secondary (general) users while minimizing the
  interference footprint on higher-tier (incumbent) users. In this work, we
  propose LBT schemes that allow opportunistic access to licensed, CBRS spectrum
  and test our LBT schemes on a custom testbed with multiple software-defined
  radios and a real-time signal analyzer. We find that by allowing LBT spectrum
  sharing in a two-carrier, two eNB scenario, we see upwards of 50%
  user-perceived throughput (UPT) gains for both eNBs. Furthermore, we examine
  the use of Q-learning to adapt the energy-detection threshold (EDT), combating
  problematic topologies such as hidden and exposed nodes. When adapting the EDT
  of opportunistically transmitting nodes, we see up to 350% gains in average
  secondary node UPT in certain difficult topologies with merely a 4% reduction
  in primary node UPT.
