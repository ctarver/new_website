abstract: We propose a mechanism for unlicensed LTE channel selection that not
  only takes into account interference to and from Wi-Fi access points but also
  considers other LTE operators in the unlicensed band. By collecting channel
  utilization statistics and sharing this information periodically with other
  unlicensed LTE eNBs, each eNB can improve their channel selection given their
  limited knowledge of the full topology. While comparing our algorithm to
  existing solutions, we find that the similarity between sensed Wi-Fi
  occupation at neighboring eNBs greatly impacts the performance of channel
  selection algorithms. To achieve better performance across diverse scenarios,
  we expand on our statistical channel selection formulation to include
  reinforcement learning, thereby balancing the shared contextual information
  with historical performance. We simulate operation in the unlicensed band
  using our channel selection algorithm and show how Wi-Fi load and inter-cell
  interference estimation can jointly be used to select transmission channels
  for all small cells in the network. Our approaches lead to an increase in
  user-perceived throughput and spectral efficiency across the entire band when
  compared to the greedy channel selection.
