abstract: Digital predistortion (DPD) is an effective way of mitigating spurious
  emission violations without the need of a significant backoff in the
  transmitter, thus providing better power efficiency and network coverage. In
  this paper, an iterative version of the IM3 sub-band DPD, proposed earlier by
  the authors, is presented. The DPD learning is iterated between the higher and
  lower IM3 sub-bands until a satisfactory performance is achieved for both of
  them. A sequential DPD learning procedure is also presented in order to reduce
  the hardware complexity when higher-order nonlinearities are incorporated in
  the DPD learning. Improvements on the convergence speed of the adaptive DPD
  learning are also achieved via incorporating a variable learning rate and
  training from previous values. A WARPLab implementation of the proposed DPD is
  also shown with excellent suppression of the targeted spurious emissions.
