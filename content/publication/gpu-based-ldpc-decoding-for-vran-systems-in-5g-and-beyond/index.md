abstract: Next-generation virtual radio access networks (vRAN) will benefit from
  the flexibility provided by virtualization in proposed Cloud-RAN
  configurations. These systems for 5G and beyond may consist of commodity
  hardware such as GPUs in data centers with multiple connected base stations
  (gNBs) flexibly receiving allocated resources depending on time-varying,
  real-time demands. In this paper, parallel reconfigurable algorithms and
  architectures for channel decoding are proposed. In particular, flexible rate
  and block length LDPC decoders for the new radio (NR) physical layer on GPU
  are characterized. We implement these GPU decoders using reduced word lengths
  of 8-bits to represent the log-likelihood ratios during decoding, and we
  utilize multiple GPU streams to process multiple blocks of codewords in
  parallel. These techniques allow our implementation to reduce the device
  transfer overhead and achieve the low-latency or high-throughput targets for
  5G and beyond. Moreover, we integrate our decoder into the Open Air Interface
  (OAI) NR software stack to investigate virtualization capabilities when
  containerizing vRAN functionality such as the LDPC decoder.
