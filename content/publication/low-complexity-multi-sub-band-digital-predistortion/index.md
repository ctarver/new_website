abstract: The nonlinearities of power amplifiers combined with non-contiguous
  transmissions found in modern, frequency-agile, wireless standards create
  undesirable spurious emissions through the nearby spectrum of data carriers.
  Digital predistortion (DPD) is an effective way of combating spurious emission
  violations without the need for a significant power reduction in the
  transmitter leading to better power efficiency and network coverage. In this
  paper, an iterative, multi sub-band version of the sub-band DPD, proposed
  earlier by the authors, is presented. The DPD learning is iterated over
  intermodulation distortion (IMD) sub-bands until a satisfactory performance is
  achieved for each of them. A sequential DPD learning procedure is also
  presented to reduce the hardware complexity when higher-order nonlinearities
  are incorporated in the DPD learning. Improvements in the convergence speed of
  the adaptive DPD learning are also achieved via incorporating a variable
  learning rate and interpolation of previously trained DPD coefficients. A
  WARPLab implementation of the proposed DPD is also shown with excellent
  suppression of the targeted spurious emissions.
