abstract: A method of operating a base station (BS) for a coexistence operation
  in a wireless communication system is provided. The method comprises
  performing a first measurement of first signals received from neighbor BSs
  over channels that are shared with the neighbor BSs before receipt of a
  spectrum access grant from a network entity; generating a registration request
  comprising a first measurement report based on the first measurement of the
  first signals; transmitting, to the network entity, the registration request
  comprising the first measurement report of the first signals; receiving the
  spectrum access grant from the network entity; and performing a second
  measurement of second signals received from the neighbor BSs over the channels
  that are shared with the neighbor BSs after receiving the spectrum access
  grant from the network entity.
