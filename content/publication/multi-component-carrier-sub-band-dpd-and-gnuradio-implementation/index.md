abstract: Digital predistortion (DPD) is an effective way of mitigating spurious
  emission violations without the need of a significant backoff in the
  transmitter, thus providing better power efficiency and network coverage. In
  this paper, the IM3 subband DPD, proposed earlier by the authors, is extended
  to more than two component carriers (CCs) through a sequential learning
  solution. The DPD learning is iterated over each spurious emission generated
  by each pair and trio of CCs. We train and apply the DPD coefficients for the
  intermodulation distortion (IMD) products until a satisfactory performance is
  achieved. The algorithm is tested in simulations using MATLAB and in a novel,
  real-time implementation on a CPU via a software version of the algorithm
  using GNURadio.
