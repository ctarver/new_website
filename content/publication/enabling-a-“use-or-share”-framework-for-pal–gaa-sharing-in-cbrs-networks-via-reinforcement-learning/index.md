abstract: By implementing reinforcement learning-aided listen-before-talk (LBT)
  schemes over a citizens broadband radio service (CBRS) network, we increase
  the spatial reuse at secondary nodes while minimizing the interference
  footprint on higher-tier nodes. The federal communications commission
  encourages “use-or-share” policies in the CBRS band across the priority access
  license (PAL)-general authorized access (GAA) priority tiers by
  opportunistically allowing the lower-priority GAA nodes to access unused
  higher-priority PAL spectrum. However, there is currently no mechanism to
  enable this cross-tier spectrum sharing. In this paper, we propose and
  evaluate LBT schemes that allow opportunistic access to PAL spectrum. We find
  that by allowing LBT in a two-carrier, two eNB scenario, we see upward of 50%
  user-perceived throughput (UPT) gains for both eNBs. Furthermore, we examine
  the use of Q -learning to adapt the energy-detection threshold (EDT),
  combating problematic topologies, such as hidden and exposed nodes. With
  merely a 4% reduction in primary node UPT, we see up to 350% gains in average
  secondary node UPT when adapting the EDT of opportunistically transmitting
  nodes.
