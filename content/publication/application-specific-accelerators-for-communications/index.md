abstract: For computation-intensive digital signal processing algorithms,
  complexity is exceeding the processing capabilities of general-purpose digital
  signal processors (DSPs). In some of these applications, DSP hardware
  accelerators have been widely used to off-load a variety of algorithms from
  the main DSP host, including the fast Fourier transform, digital filters,
  multiple-input multiple-output detectors, and error correction codes (Viterbi,
  turbo, low-density parity-check) decoders. Given power and cost
  considerations, simply implementing these computationally complex parallel
  algorithms with high-speed general-purpose DSP processor is not very
  efficient. However, not all DSP algorithms are appropriate for off-loading to
  a hardware accelerator. First, these algorithms should have data-parallel
  computations and repeated operations that are amenable to hardware
  implementation. Second, these algorithms should have a deterministic dataflow
  graph that maps to parallel datapaths. In this chapter, we focus on some of
  the basic and advanced digital signal processing algorithms for communications
  and cover major examples of DSP accelerators for communications.
