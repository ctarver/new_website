I am visiting [National Chiao Tung University (NCTU)](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en) in Hsinchu, Taiwan for the next two weeks. We are collaborating with the [free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/) team here including [Prof. Jyh-Cheng Chen](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~jcc/). 

Free5GC is an open-source project for 5th generation (5G) mobile core network. Their stage 2 release will be very soon and include many features of the 5G CN including the service based interface. 

We are hoping to use Free5GC along with [RENEW at Rice University](https://renew.rice.edu/) for research and experiments for next generation RAN deploynments including CloudRAN and Cell Free.
