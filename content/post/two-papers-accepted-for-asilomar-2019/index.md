The two papers I was involved with and submitted to [Asilomar](https://www.asilomarsscconf.org/) this year were accepted. The first paper is "Neural Network DPD via Backpropagation through a Neural Network Model of the PA." This work is the foundation of the idea which I expanded on for my [SIPS submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00766). In this paper, we propose performing digital predistortion by modeling the PA as a neural network (NN). We can then backpropagate through the PA NN model to train a NN for performing the DPD. My coauthors are [Liwen Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liwenjiang/) and [Aryan Sefidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-sefidi/), rising senior undergrad students at Rice. These undergraduates worked with me in the [verically integrated projects](http://cavallaro.rice.edu/vip-group/) group to develop the experiments that will appear in the paper. 

The second paper is "Design Trade-offs for Decentralized Baseband Processing in Massive MU-MIMO Systems." The primary author of this paper is [Kaipeng Li](http://kl33.blogs.rice.edu/). This paper expands upon the work he did in his [Ph.D. thesis](https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/105428/LI-DOCUMENT-2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
