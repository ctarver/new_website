## Web-based
### Roam Research
The bidirectional links in Roam Research changed my note taking forever.

### Readwise
[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) collects all of your highlights from Kindle, Pocket, etc. in one place and provides a daily review. It also will export your highlights to another service such as Roam. This app was one that instantly became part of my workflow, and I highly recommend it.
